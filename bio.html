    <p>Lisa Hawkins was born in the Galapagos Islands to the sound of mermaids singing as her mother lay on the back of a giant tortoise. That unconventional start in life made Lisa the idiosyncratic and fearless writer she is today.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>The youngest of three sisters, Lisa grew up with her head constantly in a book and a pen in her hand ready to note the macabre and grotesque she perceived in the world around her. Her parents, Daniel and Audrey, were nomads that settled and uprooted their daughters according to their impulses. The restless souls changed their minds as often as the shifting winds, imbuing Lisa with a mercurial temperament. Family Hawkins roamed the world for years, eschewing traditional living and schooling arrangements. </p>
    <br>
    <p>A precocious writing talent, Lisa had her first book The Bloody Funeral published aged thirteen. She is the youngest author to be given the Machete Award for Horror Fiction, which she received for her debut novel. Universal acclaim led to her being crowned The Queen of Terror. Her books have to date been sold in over 100 countries and translated into multiple languages, such as Mandarin, Silbo Gomero and Klingon.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>In her fiction, Lisa presents a twisted world of relatable nightmares from which her protagonists and readers can never wake up. Do you dare to step inside her fabricated, horrifying visions?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Lisa's latest book Window of Death will be available to buy from 3rd March 2022.</p>
